# Sudoku-in-Seconds

Here is a Sudoku Solver that identifies a *Sudoku board configuration* from an input image and solves the matrix puzzle in no time.
To support two modes of input, we have:-
- (a) The **webcam** mode : where the user just needs to point his webcam towards a Sudoku board and the solution is shown on-screen in real time.
      By solution, I mean the missing boxes getting filled thereby completing the Sudoku as per the constraints.
- (b) The **static** mode : where the user needs to keep images of unsolved Sudoku boards in an image folder. 
      On running the program, it automatically selects images from the folder and solves them.
